# Description

Here you will find a restAPI to make queries and requests to a fake database (.json file), and depending on the validations you will get a response.

## Steps to clone and run the repo

Open Git Bash (or your preferred terminal) and change the current directory to the location where you want to clone this repo, then type:

```
git clone https://github.com/JulianLIMe/restAPI_FakeDB_TS.git
cd resAPI_FakeDB_TS
npm instal
npm run dev
```

In this case you are going to run the repository with .ts files

## Compile and run .ts to .js in build folder

The Compiler will transpile the .ts files to .js, and you will be able to run the same restAPI but with .js files

```
npm run tsc
npm start
```
